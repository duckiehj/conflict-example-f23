Merge conflicts happen, DO not fear them!!!!!!!!

This is content that was most defintely added through the GitHub interface. I am purposely causing a merge conflict.

Thid sentefnce was addefd locally using the GitHub desktop app.

This is a repo that is used, in class, to demonstrate how to solve a merge conflict when it occurs with your teammates. Sometimes Github will automatically solve the issue, other times it cannot and requires human intervention!
