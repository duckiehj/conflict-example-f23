Merge conflicts, DO NOT fear Them!!!!

This is content that was defintely added through the GitHub Interface. I am causing a merge conflict to show the class.

This sentefnce was addefd locally.

This is a repo that is used, in class, to demonstrate how to solve a merge conflict when it occurs with your teammates. Sometimes Github will automatically solve the issue, other times it cannot and requires human intervention!
